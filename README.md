“As a Surgical Oncologist, I have witnessed the impact that appropriate and inappropriate treatment has on the evolution and survival of patients. The only real advances in research have been possible through large capital investments.  We all know that the healthcare sector needs a radical change, and the only way to do it is through innovation, using new technologies, and having the capital to invest. If we are all able to collaborate, I think we can make a difference and help thousands of people”
